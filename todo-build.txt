FUNK

* Replace funklibs with a module for each library (SDL, DevIL, etc).
* Replace funk src code inclusion with a funk-config.cmake style module.
* Include headers and gm files into vcproj with correct path structure.
* Copy DLLS into output folder.

MODULES

* Setup a module-only build which does not include win32 stuff.
* Setup a way to build/run gm code without funkengine calls.
* Seperate funk related script access from module code if possible.
